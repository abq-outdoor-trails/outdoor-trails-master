			Site Purpose
		</h1>
		<p>
			We are creating an urban bike trail app and website for tourists and locals to explore destinations
			and commute routes in Albuquerque. Albuquerque features 280 sunny days a year and 400 miles of bike trails.
			This resource will be used to boost awareness of bike commuting, and help bolster Albuquerque as a top bike year
			round tourist destination in the southwest.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will include a way for users to save their favorite trails and also include a list and
			routes of local favorite trails- like best bike trails to commute to Sandia National Labs
			and best tourist routes in old town and along the bosque.

		<h2>
			Persona 1 - Jake Powers
		</h2>
		<p>
			age 26
		</p>
		<p><img src="jake-powers.jpg" alt="Jake Powers" height="500" width="500"/></p>
		<p>
			As a power user- I should be able to plan and save routes to my profile. I should be able to
			plan future routes based on the routes I have saved.
		</p>
		<p>

			Occupation: Engineer and Sandia National Labs.
			He recently moved here for work and is currently renting a house near the base of the
			Sandia Mountains. He has a laptop at home but usually uses his phone for finding information
			on the internet. He owns an iPhone Xs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Goal: He wants to locate  places to hike and bike on the weekends,
			and also would like to  find a bike path he can take to work.
			He is single and drives a used 2012 Toyota 4 Runner.
		</p>
		<p>
			Frustrations: He would like to find a safe route to get to
			Sandia National Labs. Traffic can be a bit hazardous on the main
			streets and even if he had to take a longer route, he would take it to avoid
			riding in a major street.

		<h2>
			Persona 2 - Abby West
		</h2>

		<p>
			Age 40
		</p>
		<p><img src="abby-west.jpg" alt="Abby West" height="500" width="650"/></p>

		<p>
			As a casual user- I should be able to view possible routes to fun destinations for my
			family to use while on vacation in Albuquerque.
		</p>
		<p>
			Occupation- tourist, blogger and stay at home mom.
		</p>

		<p>
			Goal: Family vacation is planned for the balloon fiesta in Albuquerque.
			The vacation rental she booked has bikes available for the family to use and
			according to Trip Advisor, the best way to get to the balloon fiesta park is on
			bike. She would like to map a route out for her family of 4 to get to the balloon
			fiesta and avoid the traffic she has heard so much about regarding the balloon fiesta.
			The family will be staying near Old Town Albuquerque and would also like to explore the
			bosque and other bike trails while they are in town for their visit. They are an
			active family and enjoy doing things outdoors together. Abby does most of her vacation
			research on her laptop, but will be using her phone to navigate destinations once they
			arrive in Albuquerque.
		</p>

		<p>
			Frustrations - planning a trip to New Mexico for the balloon fiesta has been a bit
			different than most of her vacation planning experiences. There is a lot of research
			required, and planning involved to keep her family engaged and active on this vacation.
			She wants to use our app to help keep her family active and not just cooped up in the
			vacation rental for her entire vacation.

# Ground Rules Document (Will, Chrystal, and John)

## Group meeting Fridays
* 7:15 am
* Take notes in case someone has to miss
* Make a concerted effort to attend.  Things will come up, but try to preserve this time for the group's benefit

## Work Guidelines
* Accountable to ourselves and our team members first and foremost
* Always make sure we have one ticket in progress (FIFO)
* Don't expect project replies after 9:30 pm
* Peer coding a valid and valuable option when others have a free moment
* Understand that we have to sacrifice some personal work time for group benefit/group coding
* Ping questions through Slack, unless emergency.
* Put effort into researching our own questions first, then reach out to others.
* Encourage positive reinforcement.

## Appreciaton/Celebration
* Lunch Mondays outdoor tables/restaurant maybe(?)
* Celebrate success as a team.

## Conflict Resolution
* Breathe, take stock of the situation, consider our own reactions, and decide on next steps.  Try to deal with conflict quickly, avoid temptation to ignore it.
* Allow somebody to step away if tensions are high/allow for a 'cooling off' period, but make sure to come back to the conflict.
* Address the conflict privately, there is no need to discuss group conflict in front of the entire class.  Grab a break room, go for a walk, whatever needs to be done.
* Determine the appropriate medium to resolve the issue.  Should this be done over Slack?  Face to face conversation? (I personally prefer face to face, but understand that people might not always feel that this is the best option for the scenario)
* Create an opening for conversation: frame the conversation by stating that a conflict occured, reinforce that everyone should have a chance to express their understanding/feelings about the conflict.
* Actively listen to the other person's position.
* If no resolution can be reached, then escalate to technical leads.

* If one of us is having an issue, it's important to bring that up sooner rather than later.  We should not get in the habit of letting frustrations fester.

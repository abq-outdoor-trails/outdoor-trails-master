Master repo for ABQ outdoor trails app

## Database Identification:
For bike trails we will use a CSV file (BikePaths.csv) which has details about path coordinates, path type, direction(east to west, etc), posted speed limits(for bike lanes on roads), surface type, and other details.  We think this will be enough data to work with.

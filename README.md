ABQ Bike trails utilized the city of Albuquerqueâ€™s [bike paths open data set](http://data.cabq.gov/community/bikepaths/) to plot the safest bike routes for commuters and visitors looking to explore the The Duke City by bike. We used the LAMP stack on the back-end with React, Bootstrap, and Mapbox GL on the front-end.
